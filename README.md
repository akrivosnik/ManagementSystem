# Student Attendance Management System

A simple **Java-based backend** system for managing students, courses, and attendance records. This project is part of the **TechProAcademy Full-Stack Stream Semester Project**.

>  This project is still under development and not fully connected to Tomcat yet.

---

##  Project Overview

This is a basic **RESTful API** (without database) for handling:

- Student records
- Course details
- Attendance tracking

All data is stored **in memory**, so thereâ€™s no need for a database. The goal is to practice Java syntax, REST API creation with Java EE (JAX-RS), and local deployment with Tomcat.

##  Technologies Used

- Java SE (Core Java)
- Java EE / Jakarta EE (JAX-RS for REST endpoints)
- Apache Tomcat (for future deployment)
- HTML + JavaScript (very simple UI)
